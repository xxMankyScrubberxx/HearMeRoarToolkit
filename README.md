# HearMeRoarToolkit

I don't have a lot of comments or organisation of code yet. 
I had been just throwing stuff together to see what works first, 
but some had expressed the desire to see this or contribute.

The vision of this project is to...
*Have a hacktivist toolkit on a mobile platform
*Campaigns can be configured and distributed to
coordinate efforts
*Users can send community created messages via
-email
-SMS texts
-messaging applications
-Shareable meme type images
-Copy and paste
-TTS voice
*Allow multithreaded and looped requests/sending
of packets via
-UDP
-TCP
-ICMP

Long term goals are...
*push notifications/alerts for coordinated
campaigns and current efforts
*list of government officials
-names
-positions
-country
-state/province/etc
-email
-phone
-text
-fax
-website
